# UnityTools Essentials by Marco Ormello

My personal repository of Unity tools. With a focus on usability and scalability. This collection comprises essential tools that I rely on in nearly every game development project.

## Tools

-   [Universal Object Pool](https://github.com/marcoormello/MarcoOrmelloUnityTools/UniversalObjectPool/README.md): A C# script for Unity that allows you to easily create and manage object pools.
-   [ObjectIndexer](https://github.com/marcoormello/MarcoOrmelloUnityTools/ObjectIndexer/README.md): A Unity script that allows you to index any object in a given asset folder and provides filtering capabilities.
